# FTP File Explorer Application - Comprehensive Documentation

## Project Overview

This is an Electron-based FTP file explorer application with an optimized caching system designed for efficient file management and browsing of FTP servers.

## Current Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Client Application (Electron)
- **Main Process** (`main.js`): Handles application lifecycle and system integration
- **Renderer Process** (`renderer.js`): Manages UI interactions and user interface
- **Preload Script** (`preload.js`): Provides secure API bridge between main and renderer processes

#### 2. FTP Client (`utils/ftp-client.js`)
- Core FTP functionality with optimized caching
- Uses `basic-ftp` library for FTP connections
- Implements persistent JSON-based cache system per user
- Handles FTP access denied errors gracefully
- Supports multiple file types with proper icons

#### 3. Configuration Management (`utils/config.js`)
- Encrypted storage using `crypto.createCipherGCM`
- Secure configuration handling
- User credentials and settings management

#### 4. User Interface (`renderer/`)
- HTML/CSS/JS components
- File tree and file list views
- Responsive design with modern UI elements

### Cache System

#### Location and Structure
- **Cache Directory**: `client/Caching/`
- **File Naming**: `ftp_cache_{username}.json`
- **Format**: Compact JSON without indentation for optimal performance

#### Cache Features
- **TTL**: 48 hours for extended cache validity
- **Versioning**: Version 3 cache system
- **User-Specific**: Individual cache files per user
- **Optimized Depth**: Reduced directory traversal (maxDepth=1-2)

## Performance Optimizations

### Directory Traversal Optimizations
1. **buildDirectoryStructure**: Reduced maxDepth from 3 to 2 levels
2. **loadDirectoryContents**: Reduced maxDepth from 3 to 1 level
3. **refreshCache**: Reduced depth from 2 to 1 level

### File I/O Optimizations
1. **Compact JSON**: Removed indentation to reduce file size
2. **Local Cache Storage**: Moved from system userData to local `client/Caching`
3. **Extended TTL**: Increased from 24 to 48 hours
4. **Cache Versioning**: Implemented version 3 system

## Completed Bug Fixes

### Security and Compatibility
- ✅ Fixed `crypto.createCipher` deprecation by replacing with `crypto.createCipherGCM`
- ✅ Added proper exception handling for FTP access denied errors
- ✅ Fixed `electronAPI` undefined error by adding missing comma in preload.js

### Performance and Functionality
- ✅ Fixed cache timing issues causing empty folder display
- ✅ Updated FTP server IP from 10.0.0.113 to 223.25.98.220
- ✅ Fixed file explorer not showing files with optimized caching
- ✅ Added `loadDirectoryContents` to module.exports in ftp-client.js
- ✅ Verified file type support for various extensions (xlsx, txt, etc.)

## Future Development Plan

### Phase 1: Chat Removal
- Remove chat functionality completely
- Delete `chat-client.js` and server components
- Update UI to remove chat-related elements
- Clean up configuration to exclude chat settings

### Phase 2: CRUD File Operations

#### File Upload
- Implement drag-and-drop upload functionality
- Add browse and select upload option
- Progress indicators for upload operations
- Batch upload support

#### File Delete
- Add delete confirmation dialogs
- Implement batch delete operations
- Soft delete with recovery option
- Progress tracking for bulk deletions

#### File Update/Edit
- Enable in-place file editing for text files
- File replacement functionality
- Version control for file updates
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits

#### Enhanced Download
- Improve existing download functionality
- Add progress indicators
- Resume interrupted downloads
- Batch download operations

### Phase 3: Performance Enhancements

#### Process Optimization
- Faster execution for all file operations
- Optimized FTP connection pooling
- Concurrent operation support
- Background processing for non-blocking operations

#### Advanced Caching
